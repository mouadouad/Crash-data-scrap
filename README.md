# Crash-data-scrap
First, we scrap imges from a website, we use an AI model that we trained to identify numbers from the images, we store the data, then we process the data. 
The website is about a gambling game, where you put your money, and there is a multiplier number that keeps going up (screensot), and you should take out your money before it crashes.
The idea behind this project is to scrap the data about when the game crashes, and see if there is a winning strategy. There isn't.
